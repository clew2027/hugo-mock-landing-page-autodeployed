# hugo-mock-landing-page

This project is a mock landing page for the app Beli, created using the Hugo Bootstrap Theme. The page showcases the app's features, including personalized dining experiences, curated recommendations, and tools for planning culinary events. The design is responsive and built with Bootstrap for a modern and user-friendly interface.

To update my Hugo page to include workflows, I first troubleshooted a syntax error in config.toml, ensuring there were no hidden characters or BOM issues. After confirming the file was correctly formatted, I configured my repository to deploy via GitHub Pages by setting up the gh-pages branch. I built the site using Hugo, then manually pushed the generated static files to gh-pages, verifying that the theme and configurations were correctly applied. To streamline future deployments, I explored automation using ghp-import and verified the setup by running hugo server locally before finalizing the workflow.
